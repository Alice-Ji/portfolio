              <h2>Full Case Narrative</h2>
          
              <p>
                AI writing tools have quietly become infrastructure. For many users, they function
                less like collaborators and more like spellcheck: always on, rarely questioned,
                woven into the act of writing itself. As these tools fade into the background,
                concerns about authorship and “losing one’s voice” persist, but remain poorly
                understood at the level of interface design.
              </p>

              <p>
                For product teams, this creates a design challenge: how to scale AI assistance
                without undermining user trust, ownership, or long-term adoption.
              </p>              
          
              <p>
                This project investigates a deceptively simple question:
                <strong>when does AI assistance stop feeling like help and start feeling like
                replacement?</strong> Drawing on the Ship of Theseus paradox, I examine how repeated
                AI interventions affect users’ sense of authorship across different writing
                contexts—and what this means for designing AI-assisted writing tools that respect
                user autonomy.

                How does repeated AI rewriting influence perceived authorship,

              <h2>Study Design</h2>
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="https://alice-ji.github.io/portfolio/assets/theseus1.png"
                />
              </figure>              
              <p>
                To explore these questions, I designed a within-subjects experimental study that
                combined behavioral measures with qualitative follow-up.               
                This design enabled controlled comparison of ownership trajectories while holding
                individual writing style constant, supporting causal interpretation of context effects.
              </p>
       
              <p>Participants completed three writing tasks representing distinct writing contexts:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Casual text</strong> (e.g., a message to a friend)</li>
                <li><strong>Essay paragraph</strong> (formal, academic writing)</li>
                <li><strong>Code snippet</strong> (functional, task-oriented writing)</li>
              </ol>
          
              <p>
                Each participant wrote an original piece in each category, then passed the text
                through an AI writing tool of their choice ten consecutive times, with each iteration
                building on the previous output.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                After every rewrite, participants rated the text on a 1–7 scale:
              </p>
          
              <blockquote>
                “How much does this still feel like it’s yours?”
              </blockquote>
          
              <p>
                This design allowed me to model how perceived ownership changed over time and how
                that trajectory differed by context.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Qualtrics</li>
                <li><strong>Sample:</strong> Convenience sample (friends, family, online volunteers)</li>
                <li><strong>Modeling goal:</strong> Estimate non-linear decay in perceived ownership across contexts</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Mixed-effects modeling in R (<code>lme4</code>) with
                  natural splines to capture non-linear decay</li>

                All responses were anonymized and analyzed at the aggregate level.

              <h3>1. Perceived authorship decays, but not uniformly</h3>
              <p>
                Across all conditions, perceived ownership declined with repeated AI rewriting.
                However, the rate and magnitude of decay varied sharply by context.
              </p>
          
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Texting:</strong> Ownership dropped steeply by iteration 3</li>
                <li><strong>Essay writing:</strong> Declined more gradually, crossing the midpoint later</li>
                <li><strong>Code:</strong> Remained largely stable across iterations</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                Participants reached the point where text felt “more AI than me” (below the scale
                midpoint) at iteration 3 for texting, iteration 7 for essays, and never for code.
              </p>
          
              <h3>2. Emotional intimacy predicts resistance to AI assistance</h3>
              <p>
                The more personal the writing, the faster users rejected AI intervention. Text
                messages (messy, informal, emotionally loaded) were where participants felt most
                protective. AI edits in this space were frequently described as invasive, even when
                technically improving the text.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Essay writing occupied a middle ground, while code was treated as almost entirely
                functional. In this context, AI assistance was often described as welcome or even
                necessary.
              </p>
          
              <h3>3. Help feels different from replacement</h3>
              <p>
                Participants consistently distinguished between AI that supported their intent and
                AI that substituted their voice. Highly polished outputs sometimes increased
                discomfort in intimate contexts, reinforcing the feeling of being overwritten.
              </p>
            </section>
          
            <section class="case-interpretation">
              <h2>Interpretation</h2>
              <p>
                Resistance to AI writing assistance is not driven by general mistrust of AI quality.
                Instead, it reflects differences in psychological ownership and emotional risk.
              </p>

              <p>
                From a systems perspective, AI writing assistance operates along a spectrum of
                acceptable delegation rather than a binary opt-in/opt-out model.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Writing that functions as identity invites protection; writing that functions as
                utility invites automation. This produces a gradient of acceptable assistance rather
                than a binary preference for or against AI.

            <section class="case-conclusion">
              <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
              <p>
                As AI writing tools become ubiquitous, users increasingly feel pressure not only to
                write authentically, but to prove that they did. Respecting psychological 
                ownership is therefore critical not only for usability,
                but for sustained adoption, retention, and user trust in AI-enabled products.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                The future of AI writing UX is about knowing when to finish a user’s sentence 
                and when to leave their typos alone.

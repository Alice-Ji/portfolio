              <h2>Full Case Narrative</h2>
          
              <p>
                Social platforms routinely experiment with hiding or removing engagement features to
                simplify interfaces or reduce toxicity. But these features are more than surface-level
                UI elements, they may quietly structure how emotional connection turns into action.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                This project asks a deceptively simple question:
                <strong>what happens to influencer persuasion when the comment button disappears?</strong>
                Not hypothetically, but in a controlled environment where everything else stays the same.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                As part of my dissertation research, I built a realistic Instagram-like platform and ran
                a large-scale experiment to isolate the psychological role comments play in influencer
                advertising.

              <p>

                influencer exposure to purchase intent?

              <ul>
                <li>Do comments increase trust or emotional closeness?</li>
                <li>Do comments change whether those feelings translate into buying behavior?</li>

                I designed a randomized controlled experiment using a high-fidelity social media prototype.
                Participants were randomly assigned to one of two platform conditions:
              </p>
          
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Comments ON:</strong> Likes and comments enabled</li>
                <li><strong>Comments OFF:</strong> Likes enabled, comments removed</li>
              </ol>
          
              <p>
                All other elements (content, layout, influencers, and ads) were held constant.
                Participants browsed the feed naturally for eight minutes, followed by exposure
                to a sponsored influencer post.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Behind the scenes, the system logged scrolling behavior, clicks, dwell time,
                and interaction patterns.
              </p>
            </section>
          
            <section class="case-methods">
              <h2>Methods & Analysis</h2>
          
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Sample:</strong> 330 participants, randomized assignment</li>
                <li><strong>Stimuli:</strong> Real posts from two virtual influencers (Rozy, Imma)</li>
                <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Parasocial interaction, trust, authenticity, product interest, purchase intent</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in R (<code>lavaan</code>)</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                SEM was used to model the full psychological pathway from platform affordance
                to emotional response to purchase intention, allowing direct comparison of
                which links were present or absent across conditions.

              <h3>1. Removing comments did not reduce liking or trust</h3>
              <p>
                At a surface level, participants formed similar levels of trust and emotional
                connection with influencers whether comments were present or not.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                If measured only through mean differences, comments appeared to “not matter.”
              </p>
          
              <h3>2. Comments determine whether emotional connection converts</h3>
              <p>
                Structural equation modeling revealed a critical difference in pathway structure.
              </p>
          
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Comments ON:</strong> Emotional closeness and trust strongly predicted purchase intent</li>
                <li><strong>Comments OFF:</strong> Those same feelings no longer translated into buying consideration</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                The emotional bond did not disappear. But it stopped functioning as a driver of action.
              </p>
          
              <h3>3. Comments act as a bridge, not an amplifier</h3>
              <p>
                Comments did not increase trust or closeness directly. Instead, they enabled
                those feelings to carry weight in decision-making.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Some breaks in the journey are structural, not visible</h3>

              <p>
                Traditional engagement metrics and surface-level journey maps suggested
                the experience was largely unchanged when comments were removed.
                However, modeling the full influence pathway revealed a hidden break:
                emotional connection no longer translated into purchase intent.
              </p>

              <p>
                This highlights an important insight for product teams:
                some UX changes do not alter how users feel or behave moment-to-moment,
                but quietly rewire which emotions actually drive outcomes.
              </p>

              <p>
                By modeling the full psychological pathway rather than isolated metrics,
                this analysis revealed a structural break in the user journey that
                traditional engagement measures would have missed.

              <h2>Interpretation</h2>
          
              <p>
                Comment sections function as psychological infrastructure. They signal social
                presence, reciprocity, and legitimacy, and allows parasocial feelings to convert
                into behavioral intent.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                When that signal is removed, influence becomes emotionally intact but behaviorally inert.

                <li>Removing features can preserve UX simplicity while breaking conversion pathways</li>
                <li>Trust does not automatically translate into action without social affordances</li>

            <section class="case-conclusion">
              <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
          
              <p>
                This study shows how small interface changes can quietly rewire influence without
                changing what users consciously notice.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                By combining journey thinking with causal pathway modeling, designers can identify
                both where experiences feel different — and where 
                <strong>influence breaks structurally</strong>.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Sometimes, removing one button doesn’t damage the experience.
                It just disconnects emotion from action.
              </p>

    <h2>What Problem This Program Addressed</h2>

    <p>
      Shoppable advertising is increasingly common across platforms, from social feeds to
      streaming television. These formats promise reduced friction between exposure and
      purchase, but they are costly to build and introduce technical and experiential
      complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite their growing use, there is little consensus on whether people actually want
      to interact with shoppable ads, when they find them helpful, and when they experience
      them as intrusive or disruptive. Industry teams frequently face uncertainty about
      whether shoppability increases value or simply adds friction.
      This uncertainty creates real product risk: teams must invest in complex technical 
      infrastructure without clear signals about user acceptance, conversion tradeoffs, 
      or long-term platform health.
    </p>

    <p>
      This research program was designed to answer a behavioral and emotional question at
      the center of this uncertainty: how do people make sense of shoppability, and how does
      that interpretation change across platform contexts such as social media and streaming TV.

    <h2>Phase 1: Qualitative Sensemaking</h2>

    <p>
      The program began with exploratory interviews to understand how people encounter and
      interpret shoppable ads in everyday life. I led a small team that conducted interviews
      with participants across age groups to capture a cross-sectional view of technology
      adoption and platform use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interview transcripts were collaboratively cleaned and coded for emergent themes.
      Rather than starting with predefined assumptions, this phase focused on identifying
      how expectations, motivation, and perceived intrusiveness surfaced organically.
      This phase functioned as generative UX research, surfacing user mental models 
      and expectation mismatches that would later inform experimental design and hypothesis testing.
    </p>

    <p>
    The resulting themes were synthesized into an insight framework mapping when shoppability 
    creates value versus friction:

      Participants frequently described shoppable ads as surprising and novel, particularly
      on television. At the same time, many expressed discomfort when these ads interrupted
      moments of relaxation or social flow, especially on social media platforms.

    <h2>Phase 2: Controlled Platform Experiments</h2>

    <p>
      Insights from the interviews informed the design of controlled online experiments
      comparing shoppable and non-shoppable ads across social media and streaming contexts.
      I collaborated with a faculty advisor and a technical partner to build a custom
      experimental platform capable of injecting ads at precise moments and recording
      interaction telemetry.
      This platform enabled precise manipulation, randomized assignment, and fine-grained 
      interaction logging, supporting causal inference rather than purely observational analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure generalizability, we tested multiple product categories and formats 
      rather than optimizing for a single vertical.

      <figcaption>
        Experimental results from Study 2 (n = 400) identify motivation–format alignment as a primary driver 
        of purchase intent, with direct implications for optimizing shoppable ad design and revenue outcomes 
        across platforms.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Shoppable ads increased attention and engagement in both contexts. However, increased
      engagement did not reliably translate into higher purchase intent. On social media,
      shoppability often reduced purchase intent, while on streaming platforms it increased
      it.

  <section class="case-methods">
    <h2>Phase 3: Living Room Behavioral Validation</h2>

    <p>
      To test whether these patterns generalized beyond online settings, I designed and
      implemented an in-person living room simulation using a mock TV interface and a
      physical remote control. Participants watched a television episode with embedded
      ads under randomized conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The setup combined eye tracking, facial expression recording, interaction logging,
      post-experience surveys, and follow-up interviews. Each session lasted approximately
      one hour and required extensive coordination and custom tooling.
      This phase prioritized ecological validity over scale, trading sample size for 
      realism to capture behaviors that are often missed in online-only studies.

    <p>
      Results replicated earlier findings. Shoppability increased attention and self-reported
      purchase intent, yet actual interaction remained rare. Interviews revealed hesitation
      driven by fear of irreversible commitment and reluctance to leave the viewing experience.

    <h2>Phase 4: The MEVN Model</h2>

      <figcaption>
        The MEVN model integrates motivation, expectation, value, and network effects to
        explain shoppable ad performance.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To synthesize findings across studies, I developed the MEVN model. The model explains
      shoppable ad performance as the interaction of four components: user motivation,
      platform expectation, perceived value, and network effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shoppability succeeds when these components align. When they conflict, engagement may
      increase while conversion suffers.
      The MEVN model functions as a decision-support tool rather than a post-hoc explanation, 
      helping teams anticipate failure modes before deploying shoppable features.

    <h2>Product & UX Implications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Align shoppability with why users are on the platform</li>
      <li>Reduce perceived commitment costs through reversibility, preview, and deferred interaction</li>
      <li>Make outcomes of interaction clear and reversible</li>
      <li>Avoid interruptive shoppability in relaxation-driven contexts</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="case-conclusion">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>
      This research program demonstrates that shoppability is not inherently good or bad.
      Its success depends on how well it fits user motivation, platform norms, and momentary
      expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      By translating an ambiguous industry question into a structured research program and
      a usable model, this work offers teams a practical framework for designing shoppable
      experiences that feel aligned rather than disruptive.
      For product, UX, and applied science teams, this work demonstrates how combining 
      qualitative sensemaking, controlled experimentation, and behavioral validation can 
      de-risk complex interactive ad formats before large-scale rollout.

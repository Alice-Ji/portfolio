              <h2>Problem Context</h2>
          
              <p>
                Pharmaceutical advertising on social media operates at the intersection of regulation,
                persuasion, and user experience. In 2014, the FDA issued guidance requiring that any
                benefit claim in a limited-space social media ad be accompanied by risk information that
                is equally clear and prominent.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                In practice, most ads technically comply but functionally fail.
                Benefits are presented through engaging narratives and visuals, while risks are relegated
                to dense, scrolling safety text that appears late in the ad.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                This creates a critical UX problem:
                <strong>Can users actually notice, process, and remember safety information well enough to
                make informed decisions?</strong>
              </p>
          
              <p>
                This project reframes pharmaceutical risk disclosure not as a legal checkbox, but as a
                usability and comprehension challenge with direct implications for patient autonomy,
                ethical persuasion, and regulatory trust.
              </p>

              <p>
                For product and policy teams, this gap represents a systemic UX risk:
                designs can meet regulatory standards while still failing user comprehension.
                This disconnect has downstream implications for patient trust, ethical persuasion,
                and long-term credibility of health communication platforms.

              <p>
                How can social media pharmaceutical ads present risk information in a way that real users
                actually attend to, understand, and remember without increasing cognitive burden?

              <h2>Study 1: Diagnostic UX Audit</h2>          
          
              <p>
                I led the user research component of a multi-institutional project by first diagnosing
                the problem. We conducted an in-person eye-tracking study to observe how users actually
                attend to benefit and risk information in real pharmaceutical ads.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fifty participants watched a diverse set of real social media pharma ads embedded within
                a simulated feed. We recorded gaze behavior frame-by-frame during benefit and risk
                segments, then assessed recall and health belief measures immediately after each ad.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                This phase functioned as a diagnostic UX audit, establishing baseline performance
                before proposing any design intervention.
                This approach allowed us to connect what users looked at with
                what they remembered and how they felt.
              </p>

                <li><strong>Method:</strong> In-lab eye tracking</li>
                <li><strong>Sample:</strong> 50 adult participants</li>
                <li><strong>Stimuli:</strong> Real pharmaceutical social media ads across conditions</li>

                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Identify breakdowns in attention and comprehension</li>
              </ul>

                This mixed-methods approach allowed us to triangulate behavioral data,
                self-report measures, and downstream decision signals, mirroring how
                product teams evaluate UX effectiveness at scale.

              <h2>Key UX Findings</h2>
          
              <h3>1. Risk information is remembered at half the rate of benefits</h3>
              <p>
                When collapsing across ads, participants recalled benefits with <strong>~64%</strong> accuracy.
                Risk recall, however, averaged only <strong>~33%</strong>.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Despite regulatory requirements for balance, users walked away with a highly asymmetric
                understanding of benefits versus risks.
                From a product perspective, this represents a comprehension gap large enough
                to undermine the intent of balanced risk-benefit communication.
              </p>
          
              <h3>2. Attention collapses during scrolling safety text</h3>

              <figure>
                <video

                  loop

                ></video>
              </figure>            

              <p>
                Eye-tracking data showed that as soon as the risk segment began, visual attention scattered.
                Participants looked at UI chrome, unrelated visuals, and feed elements, anywhere but the
                scrolling safety text.
                In UX terms, the scrolling safety text functions as a low-salience, high-cost
                information channel that users actively disengage from.
              </p>
          
              <h3>3. Ads increase urgency even when risks are not retained</h3>

              <figure>

                />
              </figure> 

              <p>
                Exposure increased perceived severity and susceptibility (key predictors of intent to
                consult a doctor) even when risk memory was poor.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                This raised a critical concern: urgency was increasing without corresponding understanding.

              <h2>Study 2: UX Redesign Experiment</h2>
          
              <p>
                Based on the diagnostic findings, I led the redesign phase focused on improving risk
                comprehension through interface-level interventions without altering regulated text.
              </p>

              <p>
                This phase reframed risk disclosure as a design experimentation problem,
                testing how alternative information architectures perform under real
                attentional constraints.
                    </p>
          
              <p>
                I introduced two design layers:
              </p>
          
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Graphic layer:</strong> Simple icons representing key side effects</li>
                <li><strong>Audio narration:</strong> Spoken delivery of the exact risk text</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>
                These interventions were fully crossed, producing four ad variants:
                original, graphic-only, narration-only, and graphic + narration.
              </p>

              <h3>1. Single-channel cues outperform layered designs</h3>
              <p>
                Both graphic and narration interventions significantly improved risk recall
                (up to ~57%), compared to the control (~37%).
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Surprisingly, combining both cues performed worse than either alone, suggesting
                cognitive overload when multiple channels compete.
                This highlights a critical UX tradeoff: adding information can improve recall
                up to a point, after which cognitive load erodes effectiveness.
              </p>
          
              <h3>2. UX effectiveness varies by condition context</h3>
              <p>
                Telemetry revealed divergent click behavior across drug categories.
                For ADHD medications, added risk cues reduced engagement.
                For depression medications, the same cues increased engagement.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                These findings suggest that risk disclosure UX must be condition-aware rather
                than universally standardized.

              <p>
                Compliance alone does not guarantee comprehension.
                Risk disclosures fail when they are treated as legal artifacts rather than user-facing
                information systems.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                Effective risk communication depends on attentional bandwidth, emotional context,
                and cognitive load, not just visibility.

              <p>
                Social media pharmaceutical ads shape health decisions for millions of users.
                If safety information is not usable, compliance becomes performative rather than protective.

                This project demonstrates how UX research can bridge regulation, ethics, and real-world
                decision-making by ensuring that critical information is not just present, but understood.
                For organizations operating in regulated spaces, this work illustrates how
                UX research can reduce ethical risk, improve decision quality, and strengthen
                long-term user trust without compromising compliance.

                <h2>Background</h2>
              
                <p>
                  My favorite local donut shop offered a “build your own donut” bar that customers
                  loved and struggled with. A massive chalkboard listed dozens of icings, toppings,
                  drizzles, and add-ons in a single undifferentiated block.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  The abundance felt generous, but in practice it produced confusion, hesitation,
                  and regret. Kids froze. Adults overthought. Group orders felt stressful.
                  Customers routinely asked clarifying questions or changed their minds mid-order.
                  From a product perspective, the chalkboard menu functioned as an 
                  unstructured interface, forcing customers to perform unnecessary cognitive work 
                  at the point of purchase.
                </p>

                  <figcaption>Before: A single, unstructured list of options created cognitive overload.</figcaption>
                </figure>
              </section>
              
              <section class="case-problem">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
              
                <ul>
                  <li>Too many options presented at once, with no structure</li>
                  <li>Unclear rules (e.g., “choose a topping” — one or many?)</li>
                  <li>No way to visualize the final donut before ordering</li>
                  <li>High decision fatigue for kids, groups, and neurodivergent customers</li>
                </ul>
              
                <p>
                  This environment mirrored classic findings in behavioral economics: when choice
                  sets become too large and poorly organized, people stall, default poorly, or walk
                  away dissatisfied.
                  These issues created clear UX failure modes: stalled decisions, reliance on staff 
                  intervention, order revisions, and post-purchase regret—all of which impact throughput, 
                  satisfaction, and perceived quality.
                </p>

                <h2>Design Framework</h2>
              
                <p>
                  I approached the redesign using principles from choice architecture, 
                  cognitive load theory, and applied decision science, treating the 
                  ordering flow as a decision system rather than a static menu.

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
              
                <h3>1. Start With Delight, Not Decisions</h3>
                <p>
                  The home screen opens with a playful animated donut rather than an immediate
                  decision. This moment of delight slows users down and reduces perceived pressure.
                </p>
            
                <figure>
                  <img src="https://alice-ji.github.io/portfolio/assets/donut-home.gif" alt="Animated donut menu screen">
                </figure>
              
                <h3>2. Structured Customization</h3>
                <p>
                  This step functioned as feature-level constraint design, guiding users through 
                  a sequence of low-effort micro-decisions instead of a single high-cost choice.
                  Toppings were grouped into seven clear categories (icing, sprinkles, drizzles,
                  etc.). Users could choose one—or none—from each group, dramatically reducing
                  cognitive load.
                </p>

                </figure>
              
                <h3>3. Real-Time Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                  Real-time rendering acted as immediate feedback, reducing uncertainty and 
                  improving decision confidence—key drivers of conversion in customizable products.
                  As users selected options, the donut updated live using layered PNG assets.
                  This eliminated ambiguity and reduced regret by making outcomes visible.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Escape Hatches for Decision Fatigue</h3>
                <p>
                  For moments of overload, I added:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A playful <strong>Randomizer</strong> that generates a donut automatically</li>
                  <li>A gentle timed nudge toward curated “House Specials”</li>
                </ul>

                  <p>
                    These elements served as intentional fallback mechanisms, allowing users to 
                    progress even under high cognitive load without abandoning the flow.

              <section class="case-flow">
                <h2>Checkout & Completion</h2>
              
                <p>
                  The cart, checkout, and receipt flows were intentionally simple, providing clear
                  feedback at every step. Subtle animations (button shakes, confetti) reinforced
                  progress without adding friction.
                </p>

                </figure>

              <section class="case-outcome">
                <h2>Outcome & Reflection</h2>
              
                <p>
                  Informal usability testing and in-situ observation suggested reduced hesitation, 
                  fewer clarification questions, and higher confidence at checkout 
                  compared to the chalkboard baseline.
                   
                    Users (especially children and neurodivergent users) responded strongly to the 
                    Randomizer and real-time visual build, often expressing excitement and confidence 
                    in their final choices.
                    In contrast to the chalkboard menu, the structured flow reduced hesitation and
                    second-guessing. Customers spent less time deliberating, asked fewer questions,
                    and appeared more satisfied with what they ordered.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  Although the project did not progress to full deployment, the MVP validated 
                  key assumptions about choice structuring, visualization, and default design 
                  under real-world constraints. It revealed how choice
                    architecture, visualization, and defaults can meaningfully improve decision quality
                    without limiting freedom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working in a small, informal team also shaped the design process. The problem space
                    was initially vague (“the menu is overwhelming”) and had to be translated into
                    concrete, testable design decisions under tight time and technical constraints.
                    This required prioritizing interventions with the highest behavioral leverage,
                    building only what could realistically be prototyped, and making tradeoffs that
                    balanced user benefit with business feasibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                The experience reinforced a core product lesson: good design is rarely about
                ideal solutions. It’s about making principled choices within real constraints, and
                knowing which details matter enough to build.
